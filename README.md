# Pig-Game
A two-player JavaScript dice game where players roll to add points, but rolling a 1 switches turns. Players can hold to save points, and the first to reach 100 wins. This project uses JavaScript for game logic, score tracking, and turn switching, making it a great practice for handling conditions and events.
